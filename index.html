        <p class="sectionTag text-big">ISRO</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) stands as a testament to India's prowess in space exploration, technology, and innovation. Established in 1969, ISRO has evolved into one of the world's leading space agencies, gaining recognition for its pioneering missions, cost-effective methodologies, and groundbreaking achievements. Founded by Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, ISRO's primary objective has been to harness space technology for various national tasks and to propel India's development across multiple domains.

            At its core, ISRO embodies a multifaceted approach encompassing satellite development, launch vehicle technology, space science research, and international collaborations. Its satellite program remains a cornerstone, facilitating communication, remote sensing, meteorology, and navigation services. Over the years, ISRO has crafted an impressive array of satellites catering to diverse needs, including communication satellites (like INSAT and GSAT series), Earth observation satellites (such as IRS series), navigation satellites (NAVIC), and scientific missions.
            
            ISRO's launch vehicle technology has also been instrumental in its success story. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) series have demonstrated remarkable reliability and efficiency in placing satellites into orbit. The PSLV, in particular, has garnered global attention for its consistent performance and versatility, executing numerous successful missions, including the Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) and Chandrayaan missions to the Moon.
            
            Mangalyaan, India's Mars Orbiter Mission, marked a significant milestone for ISRO and India's space exploration ambitions. Launched in November 2013, Mangalyaan made India the first Asian country to reach Martian orbit and the fourth space agency globally to do so. The mission not only achieved its objectives but also did so at a fraction of the cost of similar missions undertaken by other countries, showcasing ISRO's proficiency in cost-effective space endeavors.
            
            Moreover, Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2, India's lunar missions, have played pivotal roles in advancing our understanding of the Moon. Chandrayaan-1, launched in 2008, detected water molecules on the lunar surface, while Chandrayaan-2, launched in 2019, aimed to explore the south pole region, though the lander didn't function as intended, the orbiter continues to provide valuable data.
            
            ISRO's achievements extend beyond planetary exploration. Its satellite-based navigation system, NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation), provides accurate positioning services over India and neighboring regions, catering to a wide array of applications from transportation to disaster management.
